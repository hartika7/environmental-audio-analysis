# Environmental Audio Analysis

- This project was implemented as a coursework for Introduction to Audio Processing course in Tampere University.
- The solution performs a similarity analysis using mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) for feature extraction for a set of environmental audio samples annotated with a scene and classes. The samples are compared using cosine similarity and dynamic time warping (DTW) cost.
- Various results, such as intra-class and inter-class similarities, are displayed using histograms and heatmaps.
